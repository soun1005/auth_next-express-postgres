- This project is conducted as a technical test.
- For this project, I had to build a signup and authentication system using Next.js and Express.js. Other choices of technologies were made by me.
- The main page is the login page. Users can either log in or navigate to a page where they can sign up.
- Using the provided API, once the user is logged in, the article page appears.
- On the article page, user can logout or go to main page.
- Login and signup forms are all validated.

# Review of the project

## Highlights

- This project's purpose was technical test but I wanted to make this opportunity to learn something new. I had so much fun learning new technologies and apply it even though it was a small project.
- It's always exciting testing API that I made with postman. When it works, I feel goooodðŸ˜†

## Difficulties

- Applying new technologies(Like postgreSQL, Docker, sequelize) that I haven't used before was quite challenging.
- At first I struggled to check what's in my DB.
